## Pancakes

This is a demo project that comprises part of a wider React.js tutorial

## Set up

Pull down this repo, then run `npm install` - this should put React and all the other things on your machine

## Run the demo

Simply type `npm start` and the demo project should open in your web browser

## Make some changes

A good way to start experimenting with this is to edit index.js

Try changing `<DynamicStackOfPancakes />` to `<Pancake />`.
You'll also need to uncomment the line `import Pancake from './Pancake';`

Then try adding a prop to that Pancake component, or, adding different components.

See what you can come up with!
